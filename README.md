Web application that loosely simulates the documentation of hospital data. The homepage contains some simple Javascript and 
the other tabs use razor CRUD pages to display data imported from an SQL database as tables, with views being used to compile information 
such as average salaries of employees and additional javascript developed to produce charts based on the data in the tables. Unfortunately,
I no longer have access to the SQL databases as they require an authorized connection to Hofstra University's VPn to access and edit, which
I cannot do as I am a graduate.
